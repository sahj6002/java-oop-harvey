# Library Management System

## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary
This project simulates a basic library system using Java OOP principles. It allows members to borrow and return books, while the library stores all available books.

## âœ… What I Learned
- How to encapsulate data using private fields and public getters/setters
- How to manage relationships between objects (Library â†” Book â†” Member)
- How to use Lists to track dynamic data like borrowed books
- The importance of programming to interfaces (`List` vs. `ArrayList`)

## ðŸ”§ What I Could Have Improved
- Centralizing book checkout/return logic inside the `Library` class
- Avoiding unused variables (e.g., members who aren't used in `main`)
- Replacing magic numbers like `061406` that might confuse Java's compiler
